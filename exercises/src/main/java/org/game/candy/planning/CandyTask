7.9     A Programming Task
Good OO modeling isn’t easy and requires a lot of practice. Many
developers start “modeling” in the code way too early, but doing so
isn’t a good idea because you’ll often need rebuild the code, which
ultimately costs time. Starting with a neat design makes sense, and
you should be clear: “Which class has which responsibilities, and
who talks to whom?” To document the design, UML diagrams are
helpful, and for this purpose, we recommend reviewing
documentation on the internet or picking up a book like UML
Distilled: A Brief Guide to the Standard Object Modeling Language
by Martin Fowler. Starting the design with boxes and lines on paper
or on a whiteboard can also be extremely useful.
In the previous two chapters, we laid the foundation for our
Jawbreaker game, which you are welcome to finish. Let’s briefly
summary some of its basic rules:


- At the beginning, the player has $2,000 in cash and $0 in debt.

- In the original game, drugs like cocaine, heroin, etc. were used.
  Put in your favorite candy instead. The player can buy and sell
  these in his city.

- The prices of drugs ($) in the original game ranged in values, for
  instance, cocaine costs 15,000–30,000, heroin costs 5,000–
  14,000, and so on. Prices should fluctuate randomly, and drug
  prices may decrease/increase as the player travels. Set your own
  price ranges for the candies.

- A player can carry a maximum of 100 products. (All products have
  the same weight.)

- A player can travel to various neighborhoods, such as the “Bronx,”
  “Central Park,” “Manhattan,” and so on.
- A player can’t travel to the city he is currently in.

- One trip lasts one day. During the trip, random events may
      happen, such as the following:
    - The player’s money can be stolen by a stranger.
    - During a trip, the player can find drugs now and then.
    - Depending on the distance to the selected city, a trip may cost
      more or less money.

- In the Bronx—but only there—you can program 1) a bank for
  deposits/withdrawals, 2) a stash for securing drugs, and 3) a loan
  shark for lending money.
    - The player can borrow money from the loan shark only if he has
      no debts.
    - Debt interest is 10% per day.
    - Savings interest is 5.5% per day.

- After 30 days, the game is over. Then, profits and debts are offset
  to calculate a final score.


You’re invited to add more rules to the game. A text interface can
also be implemented using Java thanks to an open-source library
like https://github.com/mabe02/lanterna.

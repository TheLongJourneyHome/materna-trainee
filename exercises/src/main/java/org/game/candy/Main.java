    IntelliJ IDEA is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Java, Kotlin, and other programming languages.
    One of the features of the IDE is the ability to customize the color scheme,
    which allows you to change the colors used for various elements of the user interface, such as the background, text, and syntax highlighting.

    In addition to the color scheme, IntelliJ IDEA also provides a line coverage feature,
    which allows you to see how much of your code is covered by tests.
    The line coverage feature uses different colors to indicate the coverage status of each line of code:

        Full coverage:
            This color is used to indicate lines of code that have been executed during a test and
            that have passed.
            The default color for full coverage is green.
        Partial coverage:
            This color is used to indicate lines of code that have been executed during a test
            but that have not been fully covered.
            The default color for partial coverage is yellow.
        Uncovered:
            This color is used to indicate lines of code that have not been executed during a test.
            The default color for uncovered lines is red.

    You can configure the colors for the line coverage by go to settings->Editor->Code coverage and
    you can find the options to change the colors according to your preferences.*/
